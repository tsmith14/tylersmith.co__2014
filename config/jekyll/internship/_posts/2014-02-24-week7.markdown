This week my partner and I started discussing the details of the contract with DIME. We are trying to figure out the numbers for the contract. 

We decided that in order to start generating interest, we needed to have a landing page with signups. After a 6 or 7 hours, here's the result: [TeacherTeams](http://teacherteams.com). In order to get this site setup, I had to setup emails for TeacherTeams. We are using [Hover](https://www.hover.com/), a domain hosting company, to manage our email accounts. Additionally, this site has [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com) analytics built in so that we can not only track page visits, but also signups and twitter link clicks. 

With conferences coming up, we started making a list of conferences. Here's what we're looking at right now:
