The final week. Wow, did this semester go by fast. This week was dedicated towards renegotiating our contract with our business partner on Teacher  Teams so that we would basically run it. I had to create revenue projections, present our marketing plan to him, and try to convince him that we can make this big. After a couple of meetings, I believe we have all reached a consensus and the plan going forward looks very, very good. 

Additionally, this week I got a few social media pages setup for Teacher Teams so that we can start connecting with customers very soon. 

Going forward, getting the contract solidified will be priority number one. After that though, this summer should be a big development time. We will be attending a few conferences and we hope to have Teacher Teams demo-able by then. If all goes well, schools and districts will latch on to our idea and we'll be getting a few districts signed on very soon. I can't wait to see how it goes!
